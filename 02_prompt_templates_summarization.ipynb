    "Being more than a facility to help train and upskill our national workforce, the CCoE has the potential to be an international destination to address emerging cyber threats. We can bring together Malaysian and Canadian universities, research institutions and skilled practitioners to share knowledge, threat intelligence, and jointly develop methods and strategies to strengthen national and regional cyber-resilience. The CCoE is a milestone in our journey towards creating a robust cybersecurity ecosystem, necessitating strong partnerships across the public and private sectors.\n",
    "Towards a more secure digital environment, we can collaborate to develop plans that encourage information sharing and expertise exchange between government agencies, and other stakeholders including sharing actionable threat intelligence. We commend Blackberry for helping to upskill our next generation of cyber-defenders, accelerating our goal to bolster national and regional security and innovation. Malaysia has a shortfall of 12,000 cybersecurity professionals. We need 25,000 workers in cybersecurity by 2025. We envision this center as a capacity-building hub for the Southeast Asian region, with a specific focus on enhancing threat intelligence sharing, and fostering regional cooperation in mitigating cybersecurity threats and combating cybercrime. As the chosen location for the establishment of the CCoE, Malaysia aims to deliver upon our shared goal to establish a globally competitive skills and learning ecosystem in the Indo- Pacific region. Forging international partnerships, specifically those harnessing advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, assumes importance in the positive growth of our economy's trajectory.\n",

Under this Framework, the Government has also introduced numerous initiatives to help accelerate the growth of enterprises and services to significantly enhance their productivity as well as grow Malaysia’s cybersecurity competencies and the digital domain.

       "'Zusammenfassung:\\nDie Gründung des Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (CCoE) markiert einen wichtigen Meilenstein in der Stärkung der nationalen und regionalen Cyber-Sicherheitsfähigkeiten Malaysias. Das CCoE soll nicht nur als Trainingszentrum dienen, sondern auch als internationale Plattform zur Bekämpfung aufkommender Cyber-Bedrohungen durch den Austausch von Wissen und Expertise zwischen malaysischen und kanadischen Institutionen. Malaysia strebt an, bis 2025 25.000 Cyber-Sicherheitsexperten auszubilden, um die regionale Cybersicherheit zu stärken. Die Regierung setzt sich zudem für die Förderung von Investitionen ein, um hochwertige Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen und das Wirtschaftswachstum voranzutreiben. Die Einführung von 5G und die Erweiterung der Internetabdeckung in Malaysia sollen die digitale Transformation in verschiedenen Branchen vorantreiben. Die Absolventen des ersten Ausbildungskurses für Cyber-Verteidiger tragen bereits zur Verbesserung der Cyber-Sicherheitsfähigkeiten und zur Förderung von Innovation und beruflichem Networking bei.'"
